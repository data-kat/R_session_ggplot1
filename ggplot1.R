#$$$$$$$ R Studio tips: #$$$$$$$$$$

# To navigate headers in this script, clip at the two little up/down arrows in
#   the bottom-left corner of this text editor window
# A heading gets generated when there's 4 or more "#" at the end of the line.
# If there's no text, the heading is blank. So to simply separate out sections,
#   I generally use one "#" and some other symbol to avoid getting a blank heading
# To search and/or replace something, use Ctrl+F to bring up the search bar at the top


#$$$$$$$ Writing tips: #$$$$$$$$$$

# Keep lines short - avoid horizontal scrolling to save time
# Column names are in CAPS (personal preference)
# Use spaces as you would in the English language - after commas, on either side of "=", etc.
# Leave lots of little comments - you may not remember certain details 6 months from now

# Plotting weather data

# Read in the weather data file
wx_all = read.csv("Athol_wx.csv", skip = 1)

# Check structure of the DATETIME column:
str(wx_all$DATETIME)


# Create a NEWDATETIME column, which is the same as DATETIME,
#   but in proper datetime format
wx_all$NEWDATETIME = as.POSIXct(wx_all$DATETIME, format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")

#   Then delete the DATETIME COLUMN:
wx_all = within(wx_all, rm(DATETIME))

# Rename NEWDATETIME to DATETIME:
names(wx_all)[names(wx_all) == "NEWDATETIME"] <- "DATETIME"

# Now that DATETIME is in POSIXct format, can use "<" and ">" and plot it more easily.

# Subset the dataframe to only retain 2018 weather:
wx_jan18 = wx_all[wx_all$DATETIME >= as.POSIXct("2018-01-01 00:00:00") &
                wx_all$DATETIME < as.POSIXct("2018-02-01 00:00:00"), ]

####--------------------   _LINE PLOTS  --------------------####


# Can create a basic plot of temperature over time:
ggplot(wx_jan18, aes(x = DATETIME, y = TEMP)) +
    geom_line()

# To plot multiple variables this way, would need to specify x and y
#   within the aesthetic separately for every line:
ggplot(wx_jan18) +
    geom_line(aes(x = DATETIME, y = TEMP), color = "green") +
    geom_line(aes(x = DATETIME, y = RH), color = "red")

# But how do we insert a legend? Include color in the aes() command!
#   Note: when inside aes(), you cannot specify the actual color of the line,

ggplot(wx_jan18) +
    geom_line(aes(x = DATETIME, y = TEMP, color = "temp")) +
    geom_line(aes(x = DATETIME, y = RH, color = "RH"))

#   -> use scale_color manual().
# Bonus: it also allows us to change legend lables if needed

# Note1: to get the 째 symbol, hold down ALT and press 248 on the number pad of the keyboard

# Want to change the position of the legend?
# Basic options include "top", "bottom", "right", "left", "none"
ggplot(wx_jan18) +
    geom_line(aes(x = DATETIME, y = TEMP, color = "temp")) +

    theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Note1: change the name of the COLOR legend with:
#    + labs(color = "Your custom name")
# Note2: remove the legend title with:
#   + theme(legend.title = element_blank())

# Try it here!






# labs() allows us to change x-axis and y-axis labels, title, subtitle,
#   and title of any legend you may have
ggplot(wx_jan18) +
    geom_line(aes(x = DATETIME, y = TEMP, color = "temp")) +

              color = "blue", linetype = 6, alpha = 0.5, lwd = 1.5)

# Look at the "Linetypes and point shapes.png" for linetypes



####--------------------   _POINT PLOTS  --------------------####


# SHAPES, COLOR AND FILL

# show help document with point hapes, line widths, colors, etc.

# While lines only have color, points can have color and/or fill:

    geom_point(aes(x = 3, y = 1), shape = 21, size = 7, color = "blue", fill = "orange")
# Note that these different shapes react to color and fill arguments differntly


# By default geom_point uses shape = 19
ggplot(wx_jan18) +
    geom_point(aes(x = DATETIME, y = TEMP), color = "red")

# Look at the "Linetypes and point shapes.png" for point shapes



# Challenge:
# Try using different shapes, sizes and colors here



# ADDING A TRENDLINE

# Note that if aesthethics are recycled, it's more efficient to place all aes() info
#   into the main ggplot() call

# Default:
ggplot(wx_jan18, aes(x = DATETIME, y = TEMP)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth()

# Trend line:

#$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

# Subsetting or slicing vectors and dataframes means retrieving only parts of interest.
# It's easy to do using square barckets


####--------------   _SUBSETTING VECTORS  ------------####

# Vectors are one-dimensional, and take only ONE index or ONE list of indeces for subsetting

# Basic syntax for vectors:
#   myvector[indices_to_keep]. Let's try a few examples.

#Create a vector:
myvector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "a", "c")

# Select the first item:
myvector[1]

# Select items 3 to 4 (inclusive):
myvector[3:4]

# Select items 2 and 4 (note that the list of indices has to be in a vector of their own to work):
myvector[c(2, 4)]

# Now lets try subsetting based on value. Select all items that are equal to "a":
myvector[myvector == "a"]

# Next, select all items that are equal to "b" or "c":
myvector[myvector == "b" | myvector == "c"] # method 1
myvector[myvector %in% c("b", "c")] # method 2


####--------------   _SUBSETTING DATAFRAMES  ------------####

# Dataframes are two-dimensional, and need TWO indeces or TWO lists of indeces for subsetting

# Basic syntax for dataframes:
#   mydataset[indices_of_rows_to_keep, indices_of_columns_to_keep].

# Create a dataframe:
mydf = data.frame(FRUIT = c("apple", "orange", "pear", "cherry", "eggplant"),
                  FRUIT_TYPE = c("pome", "berry", "pome", "drupe", "berry"),
                  COST = c(2, 3, 3, 15, 8))

# Select the value in the first row and first column:
mydf[1, 1]

# Select all values in the first row:
mydf[1, ]

# Select all values in the first column:
mydf[ , 1]

# Select all rows where FRUIT_TYPE is a berry:

# Challenge1:
# Try inserting the following into facet_wrap(): scales = "free"
# Also, try specifying the number of rows or the number of columns inside facet_wrap()
#   with ncol = ... or nrow = ...





# Challenge:
# Subset the dataset to only plot years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016
# Hint: use square brackets and %in%



# Solution:
wx_4years = wx_all[wx_all$YEAR %in% c(2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), ]

# Challenge:
# Try making your own faceted plot here for years 2017 and 2018 only.
#   It can be very similar to the ones above, or can use different geometry (eg geom_line)
#   And different variable (eg TEMP and RH colored by MONTH_ABB)
# Hint: use square brackets to subset the wx_all dataset








# Solution:

wx_2years = wx_all[wx_all$YEAR %in% c(2017, 2018), ]
