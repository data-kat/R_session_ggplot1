######################      SUBSETTING OVERVIEW     ####################
#$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

# Subsetting or slicing vectors and dataframes means retrieving only the parts
# that are of interest. It's easy to do using square barckets


####--------------   _SUBSETTING VECTORS  ------------####

# Vectors are one-dimensional, and take only ONE index or ONE list of indeces for subsetting

# Basic syntax for vectors:
#   myvector[indices_to_keep]. Let's try a few examples.

#Create a vector:
myvector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "a", "c")

# Select the first item:
myvector[1]

# Select items 3 to 4 (inclusive):
myvector[3:4]

# Select items 2 and 4 (note that the list of indices has to be in a vector of their own to work):
myvector[c(2, 4)]

# Now lets try subsetting based on value. Select all items that are equal to "a":
myvector[myvector == "a"]

# Next, select all items that are equal to "b" or "c":
myvector[myvector == "b" | myvector == "c"] # method 1
myvector[myvector %in% c("b", "c")] # method 2


####--------------   _SUBSETTING DATAFRAMES  ------------####

# Dataframes are two-dimensional, and need TWO indeces or TWO lists of indeces for subsetting

# Basic syntax for dataframes:
#   mydataset[indices_of_rows_to_keep, indices_of_columns_to_keep].

# Create a dataframe:
mydf = data.frame(FRUIT = c("apple", "orange", "pear", "cherry", "eggplant"),
                  FRUIT_TYPE = c("pome", "berry", "pome", "drupe", "berry"),
                  COST = c(2, 3, 3, 15, 8))

# Select the value in the first row and first column:
mydf[1, 1]

# Select all values in the first row:
mydf[1, ]

# Select all values in the first column:
mydf[ , 1]

# Select all rows where FRUIT_TYPE is a berry:
mydf[mydf$FRUIT_TYPE == "berry", ] # don't forget the comma!

# Select only column FRUIT and COST:
mydf[, c("FRUIT", "COST")]

# List fruits that cost less than $5:
mydf[mydf$COST < 5, "FRUIT"]

# Select rows where cost is either 2 or 8 dollars:
mydf[mydf$COST %in% c(2, 8), ]


# Challenge1:
# Create a smaller dataframe that only contains rows where FRUIT_TYPE is berry or drupe






# Challenge2:
# Get the cost of the eggplant

#   with ncol = ... or nrow = ...

# Subset the dataset to only plot years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016
